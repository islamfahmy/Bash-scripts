# Bash-scripts
handy  bash scripts I wrote to speed things up on ubuntu 
<br /><br />
**Add idea** : script I use when I am working and I get an idea for a project the script when it starts it shows you all existing ideas and let you add more \
**Add Algo** : I use it to keep track of data structures and algorithms I want to learn in the future \
**speed_limit** : to limit the speed of the laptop \
**unlimited_speed** : to remove the the speed limit \
**wifi toggle** : my laptop dosn''t have a wifi on/off button so I assigned a keyboard shortcut to run this script to add it just open keyboard shortcuts add one pick your key then add the following command sh 'path to the folder of the script'/Wifitoggle.sh
